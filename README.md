## Features

- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines traditional search techniques with modern embeddings for effective information retrieval.
- **Advanced Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate your model's performance with precision and recall metrics tailored for RAG systems.
- **Monitoring**: Keep track of your application’s performance and user interactions with comprehensive observability tools.
- **Context Management**: Enhance user experience by managing context effectively to minimize hallucinations.
- **Production-Ready**: Built for enterprise needs, ensuring reliability and scalability.

## Installation

To get started with the Enterprise RAG Framework, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aninghidalgo/Enterprise-RAG-Framework.git
cd Enterprise-RAG-Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. 

## Usage

Once you have installed the framework, you can start using it to build your applications. Here’s a simple example of how to set up a basic retrieval system:

```python
from rag_framework import RAG

# Initialize the RAG system
rag = RAG()

# Load your knowledge base
rag.load_knowledge_base('path/to/knowledge_base')

# Ask a question
response = rag.ask('What is the capital of France?')
print(response)
```

This example initializes the RAG system, loads a knowledge base, and queries it for information.

## Components

### Hybrid Search

Our hybrid search combines both semantic and traditional keyword-based search techniques. This allows you to retrieve relevant documents more effectively, improving the overall user experience.

### Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is the core of the RAG system. It can consist of various data sources, including databases, documents, and APIs. You can customize the knowledge base to fit your enterprise needs.

### LLM Integration

Integrate with popular LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-3. This allows you to leverage powerful language models for generating responses based on retrieved information.

### Vector Database

Utilize vector databases like FAISS for efficient similarity search. This ensures that your retrieval process is both fast and accurate.

## Evaluation Metrics

Evaluating the performance of your RAG system is crucial. We provide several metrics to assess your model's effectiveness:

- **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of the retrieved documents.
- **Recall**: Evaluates the completeness of the retrieved information.
- **F1 Score**: Combines precision and recall into a single metric.

You can implement these metrics using the provided evaluation tools in the framework.

## Monitoring

Monitoring your application is essential for maintaining performance and user satisfaction. Our framework includes built-in monitoring tools that track:

- **User Interactions**: Understand how users interact with your application.
- **Performance Metrics**: Keep an eye on response times and error rates.
- **System Health**: Monitor the overall health of your application and its components.
